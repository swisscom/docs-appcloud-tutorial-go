This tutorial will have you deploying a Web Application base on go  in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of <%= vars.product_full %>.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

* An <a href="https://console.developer.swisscom.com" target="_blank"><%= vars.product_short %> account</a>.
* A Golang development environment.
* (optionally)  Docker for local testing.

Furthermore, you must have a first Cloud Foundry <a href="../concepts/roles.html#orgs" target="_blank">Organization</a> and <a href="../concepts/roles.html#spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> to push your apps to. In case you don't have that yet, please follow the <a href="https://console.developer.swisscom.com" target="_blank">tutorials in the web console</a> before returning here.


In this tutorial we will deploy using a binary approach. In other words we create locally a binary and we upload only this binary to cloud.
There are many reason why binary is preferred:

1. this is best practise for project written in Go.
2. efficient dependency management, because we handle them as usual locallyl
3. portability is maintained
