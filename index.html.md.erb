This tutorial will help you to deploy a Go web app in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of <%= vars.product_full %>.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

* An <%= vars.product_short %> account
* A local <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" target="_blank">Go</a> development environment
* <a href="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide" target="_blank">Glide</a> or <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep" target="_blank">dep</a> installed locally

Furthermore, you must have a first Cloud Foundry <a href="../concepts/roles.html#orgs" target="_blank">Organization</a> and <a href="../concepts/roles.html#spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> to push your apps to. In case you don't have that yet, please follow the tutorials in the web console before returning here.
