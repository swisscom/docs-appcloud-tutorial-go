<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step youâ€™ll learn how to propagate a local change to the application through to <%= vars.product_short %>. As a simple change, we'll modify the message which the app shows.

Change the `IndexHandler`'s message in `main.go` to "I am awesome!". Your final result should look something like this:

```go
func IndexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "I am awesome!")
}
```

Now test locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ go run main.go
</pre>

Visiting your application at <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a>, you should see the changed message. **You are awesome!**

Now deploy. All you need to do is `cf push` again:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-go-app
</pre>

Finally, check that everything is working by visiting your app's URL from your web browser.

<div style="text-align:center;margin:3em;">
  <a href="./environment.html" class="btn btn-primary">I can push local changes</a>
</div>
