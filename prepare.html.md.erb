In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ go get github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-go
$ cd "${GOPATH}"/src/github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-go
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a> application as well as a `glide.yaml` file, which is used by our dependency manager <a href="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide" target="_blank">Glide</a>.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: In case you are stuck during the tutorial, you can always check out the <a href="https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-go/tree/final-result" target="_blank"><code>final-result</code></a> branch of the sample app repo to see what your code should look like.
