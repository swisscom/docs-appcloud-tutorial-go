<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>


In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Firstly we build the binary in ELF 64-bit LSB format 
<pre class="terminal">
GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags "-X main.buildstamp=`date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S'` -X main.githash=`git rev-parse HEAD`" -o ./bin/gocf
</pre>


Secondly we inspect the manifest.yml file located at top level dir of the project
(link https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html)

<pre class="terminal">
--$ cat manifest.yml
applications:
- name: go-demo-app
  buildpack: binary_buildpack
  memory: 256M
  instances: 1
  path: ./bin/
  command: ./gocf
</pre>

Inspect the content of the manifest, the attributes can change accoringly.
Important here is to observe the `path` attribute because indicates what will
be uploaded to the cloud, everything with that folder. In our case  there is
only a binary which was manually built. Also the name should change
accordingly, it has to be globally unique so be creative because will be part
of the URL that your app can be reached from.


Finally we deploy the app

<pre class="terminal">
Using manifest file /Users/taakako1/gospace/src/github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-go/manifest.yml
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 256M x 1 instances
urls: go-demo-app.scapp.io
last uploaded: Fri Apr 22 13:23:45 UTC 2016
stack: unknown
buildpack: binary_buildpack

     state     since                    cpu    memory         disk         details
#0   running   2016-04-22 03:24:00 PM   0.0%   3.5M of 256M   6.6M of 1G
</pre>

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.

The above steps have 

<pre class="terminal">
make cloudpush
</pre>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:3em;">
  <a href="./logs.html" class="btn btn-primary">I have deployed my App</a>
