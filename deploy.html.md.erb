In this step, you will deploy the app to the Swisscom Application Cloud.

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the
“my-random-hostname” with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your
app will be reached from and it has to be globally unique so be creative. The
`-m 128M` tells Cloud Foundry to use 128MB of memory for our app which should be
plenty.

<pre class="terminal">
--$ cf push my-demo-app -m 128M -n <randomname>  -b binary_buildpack -c './bin/gocf'

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

Now visit the app at randomname.scapp.io to verify that is working. You can
find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.

<pre class="terminal">
--$ curl gobin.scapp.io
